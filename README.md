# Blank App/First Programme 

##  Experience during setup
My first experience with Visual Studio Code was pretty good. At first, I was just trying to figure out where everything was, but the layout was clean, so it didn’t take too long to get used to. I really liked how it highlights errors and gives suggestions while you’re typing—it made coding a lot easier. Adding extensions for the languages I was using also helped a lot. Once I got the hang of it, it felt like a tool that could really speed things up and make coding more enjoyable.

## Setup Steps
1. Create a React Native project

2. Set up the project folder structure
- Added an assets folder and placed images like favicon.png inside.

3. Write the React Native code (App.tsx)

- Imported required components (StyleSheet, Text, View, Image).
- Created a functional component App() returning a <View> with <Text> and <Image>.
- Used require() to load the local image from the assets folder.
- Styled the background red and centered content using StyleSheet.create.

4. Run the project in an Android emulator
- Opened BlueStacks as the emulator.
- Started the app using npx expo start 

5. Preview and test the output
